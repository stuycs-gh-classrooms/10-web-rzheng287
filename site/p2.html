      This is how to soft boil and egg. First we need to gater the materials! We will need:
      <img src="/home/students/2026/rzheng60/public_html/site/images/soft_boiled_eggs.jpg">
      <ul>  <li> A pot </li>
            <li> An egg(or multiple)</li>
            <li> A stove top</li>
            <li> Soup Spoon</li>
            <li> Water</li>
            <li> Timer </li>
            <li> ice </li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      After we gather the materials, fill the pot up with enough water so that it could cover the eggs completely. Bring the heat up and wait for the water inside
      the pot to boil. After it boils, lower the heat until it is simmering. After this put your eggs into the pot and cover the lid. You should set the timer to 7 minutes. Before the timer goes off, fill a bowl up with
      water and put ice in it. After the timer goes off, remove the eggs from the pot and place them into the ice water. Allow them to rest there for 3 minutes before peeling the shell and enjoying.
