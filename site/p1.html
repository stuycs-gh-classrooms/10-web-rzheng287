      This is how to scramble an egg. We will need to gather the materials!
      <img src="C:\Users\Ricky\Documents\public_html\site\images\scrambled_egg_image.jpg">
      We will need:
    <ul>  <li> A pan </li>
          <li> An egg(or multiple)</li>
          <li> Some butter OR cooking oil</li>
          <li> A stove top</li>
          <li> Spatula</li>
          <li> OPTIONAL: Seasoning (maybe not so optional)</li>
          </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      After we gather the materials, just like frying an egg put your pan on the fire. After it has heated up a bit, put some oil in and and spread it around the pan. Once the oil has heated up a bit its time for the egg.
      Take your egg or eggs and crack them on the edge of your pan. Once cracked, split open the shell and let the egg drop into the pan. Take your spatula and mix the egg around until the yolk has mixed with the egg white and
      becomes solid. You keep mixing until everything becomes solid then put seasoning in. After that mix some more and you're done!
