      Hello! Lets fry an egg. First we have to gather the materials!
      We will need: </P>
        <img src="/home/students/2026/rzheng60/public_html/site/images/fried_egg_image.jpg">
      <ul>
        <li> A pan </li>
        <li> An egg(or multiple)</li>
        <li> Some butter OR cooking oil</li>
        <li> A stove top</li>
        <li> Spatula</li>
        <li> OPTIONAL: Seasoning (maybe not so optional)</li>
        </ul>

<p>
        After we gather the material, put your pan on the fire. After it has heated up a bit, put some oil in and and spread it around the pan. Once the oil has heated up a bit its time for the egg.
        Take your egg or eggs and crack them on the edge of your pan. Once cracked, split open the shell and let the egg drop into the pan. If theres an egg shell fragment stuck in your egg, just use the egg shell
        you are holding to scoop it up. Nice! Now you wait until your egg has finished cooking, then flip it over.(Or not if you like it runny) Make sure to add your seasoning. Thats it!
