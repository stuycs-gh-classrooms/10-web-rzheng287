    <h2> What is weight lifting? </h2>
      <p>
        Weight lifting is a type of activity that requires you to put a lot of force into movinng weights. Most people do this to gain muscle and stay healthy, but anybody can start, just remember to practice safe technique.
        Weight lifting can work many muscles that simple moving around cannot achieve. Because of this you are able to target specific muscles that you want. This is particulary useful if you are recovering from an injury.

      <h2> Why should you lift? </h2>
        <p>
          Why should you weight lift? Well, to start, weight lifting is a very effective type of exercise that anybody of any physique or level can do. Whether you are trying to gain muscle for your favorite sport, or cut
          down a few pounds, or maybe best of all for fun. Gym memberships are usually inexpensive and realitivly anywhere.

          <h3> How to keep yourself safe. </h2>
            <p>
             Even though weight lifting could be for anyone, you have to practice safe technique. This usually means you focus on form, rather than weight or in simpler words learn the correct movements before picking up
              any piece of equipment to see if you can lift it. Injuries from weight lifting could be dangerous but if you practice safe technique and have a buddy you will be fine. (Also the "pain" you get after lifting
              is called a pump and not harmful.)
